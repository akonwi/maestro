- [ ] To avoid rate limiting errors, persist API-Football responses
 - need to be able to configure, which requests are cache-able
 - `fapi::fetch(req: http::Request, cache: Bool?) http::Response`
   - will return from cache if there's an entry for the request
   - if `cache` is true, then save the request + response,
