   - Error reporting and import statistics

### ✅ Import Process Flow - IMPLEMENTED

```
[Environment Setup] → [Select Leagues] → [Choose League+Season] → [Configure Mappings] → [Import]
       ↓                      ↓                      ↓                     ↓                ↓
 Build-time config     GET /leagues         Load teams/seasons    Smart suggestions   Batch import
```

## 🔄 Request Optimization

### ✅ Smart Caching Strategy - IMPLEMENTED
```typescript
interface CachedApiData {
  leagues: { data: ApiFootballLeague[]; expires: Date } | null;
  teams: { [leagueId: number]: { data: ApiFootballTeam[]; expires: Date } };
  fixtures: { [key: string]: { data: ApiFootballMatch[]; expires: Date } };
}
```

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ 24-hour cache for leagues and teams
- ✅ 7-day cache for completed fixtures  
- ✅ Automatic cache invalidation
- ✅ Memory-based caching for session performance

### ✅ Batch Processing - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Progress indicators for large imports
- ✅ Error collection and reporting
- ✅ Graceful handling of API failures
- ✅ Import statistics and feedback
